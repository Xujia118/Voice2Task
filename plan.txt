Plan
Backend
Part 1
Get audio file from frontend. This is temporarily skipped
Access an audio speech file from S3 bucket
Send this file to AWS Transcribe
Set up Transcribe to send text output back to S3

DB: 
After the actions list is fetched, user proceeds to store the info on DB.
We make it simple: get the user, store the summary.
Problem: How to locate the audio file in S3?

Fetch the text file at the backend (or directly send it to openAI if possible)

Part 2
send text file to openAI with the prompt "Summarize the text and make a list of action items"
Retrieve the AI generated action items to backend
Send the action to frontend as JSON; at the same time store it in DB together with the link to audio speech file 
(The fundamental function is done)

Part 3
Build a simple customer info query functions to know what actions should be carried out.
(If possible, also make query history)

Frontend
A simple interface that allows to record a conversation
An interface to query customer
